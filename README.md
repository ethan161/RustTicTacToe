# Overview

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against a computer in a head to head match up.

I wrote this program to gain more experience with the Rust language and memory based languages.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code was used to write this program.

The Rust language was the primary coding language, with the random and standard libraries.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- One thing I never got around to was an option for a two player mode. This would require a lot of overhaul on the overall logic, but would be a fun addition.
- Another thing would be to create a smarter computer. At the moment, it simply just chooses a random available square, but logic could be added to go for the middle or corners first.
- The simplest way I found to exit the program after you win or tie also displays a very ugly and scary warning and could be off-putting for people that play. I don't have any ideas how to fix or improve this.
